					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>
						For my Dissertation I created an application to help increase engagement of athletes with regards to their rehabilitation exercises. This was creatd in Android Studio using Kotlin over the space of this academic year. As seen in the poster below, the application showed promise in increasing this engagement. The application was a fantasy football sytle manager where the user participated in a football season and gained probability of winning their weekly matches by doing their rehab exercises. The higher percentage exercises completed, the higher percentage of winning.

						I was chosen to be a finalist in the BSC Ada Lovelace Colloquim where I got to present this poster on my application I developed.

						Once my disseration has been marked, I will add the file for download here.

					<h3>What I learnt</h3>
					<p>
						Throughout this project I was faced with many challenges, the first one was coming up with the idea for my disseration. The project came from personal experience with three torn ligaments in my knee right at the start of my final year of uni. Through my frustrations of rehabilitation I spoke to teammates from my football club and realising they had experienced the same issues with their injuries. Therefore the idea of this project was created.

						After deciding on the idea I had to learn how to use a new programming language (Kotlin) with Android studio which I have used for previous projects. This taught me a lot as I had to use my previous knowledge of other languages rules and convert them into the syntax of Kotlin. This taught me persistence, patience and gave me a key eye for detail in spotting patterns in the code I was writing.

						This project I got to learn how to integrate the Firebase Database into an android application, making handling login info easy and secure. It also dealt with the storage of teams, match schedules and customisable data.
